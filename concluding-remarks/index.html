        <p>The RIA course is coming to an end which means that it’s time to summarize the experience
I’ve had with this course.</p>
<p>To have Slack were both David and other students have been very active has been great
because it have been a place were longer discussions have been possible instead of
more usual technical questions which is what the tutoring in other courses lead to.
This fits me perfectly as I prefer to find answers to such questions by Googling or
experimenting and the discussions in this course have led to a much greater depth.</p>
<p>I also really liked how open this course is which has made it possible for me to dive
deeper into interesting techniques like Redux, Webpack, how to best style a React
application and similar things instead of focusing on getting the project done.</p>
<p>I didn’t really know what I expected as takeaways but I’m pleased with the ones I got.
I had thought that I should do more testing and functional programming but I didn’t
really get the time as I found more interesting stuff to focus on instead.</p>
<p>Even though I didn’t focus on functional programming as thought I still got rid of my
attachment to classes and did get more knowledge in other ways to design extensions.
This is thanks to the religious pressure from David on both Redux and against classes
and I see this as a big step forward and is one of my biggest takeaways from this course.
Without those long discussions I don’t think that I would have managed that.</p>
