title: RIA introduction

This is my first blog post in the RIA course at Linnaeus University.

I have a big interest in web development which have led to a lot of experimenting with different technologies. My preferred languages are Dart and Typescript because I like the non blocking-asynchronous programming model.

While my preferred editor have for long been WebStorm I'm shifting more and more towards Atom due to some great plugins. The rest of my environment is basically just terminal emulator for git and npm or pub.
